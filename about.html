      <h3>WHY SHOULD I GET YOUR SERVICES?</h3>
      <h5>5-SET CONSTRUCTION OR BID PACKAGE</h5>
      <p>If you are building in an area that requires very few copies to construct a house, or you just want to get a quote from one or more builders, this is the package for you. These sets of plans cannot be duplicated, but they come with a formal Copyright License that gives you the legal right to construct the house, and to modify (redline) the plans beforehand to suit your needs. If you need more than 5 sets, you can add them to your initial order, or order them (by phone) at a later date.</p>

      <h5>PLANS PRINTED ON MYLAR</h5>
      <p>If you – like nearly all of our customers – plan to modify our plans to suit your needs, you might want to consider purchasing a Mylar copy. Mylar was created for this purpose – it is erasable, and can be drawn upon – so the changes can be made just once on this “master” copy, instead of having to mark-up (red-line) each bond copy of the plans. After the changes have been made, you or your builder can then print as many copies as you need, whenever you need them. That way everyone will have the final version of the plans to work with.</p>

      <h5>PLANS IN PDF FORMAT (Highly Recommended)</h5>
      <p>The vast majority of our customers now purchase plans in PDF format. The biggest reason why they’re so popular is because they can be passed along instantaneously by email. You can open them right away on your own computer, and you can then zip them to your builder (or builders, for bids), your lender, and anyone needing to approve the plans before construction. Then your builder can zip them to all their sub-contractors, truss manufacturers, and (if needed) to an engineer. And if you’d still like to make modifications on Mylar sheets, your Copyright Release allows you to print on anything you’d like.</p>

      <h5>PLANS IN CAD FORMAT</h5>
      <p>If the modifications you wish to make are extensive, or are primarily structural in nature – changing the exterior wall system, altering the outline of the house, etc. – – you might be better off ordering a CAD version of the plans, if one is available. Changes can be made much more quickly, possibly saving you considerably more than the added cost of the CAD copy.</p>

Henas and Woo Jun worked on my project and they are the most wonderful people and great designers. The final design was exactly what I was looking for. They spend a lot of time to understand my requirements and the outcome was great for a complex project. They are very responsive and constantly stayed in touch even after all the final designs were completed. I couldn’t thank them enough.highly recommend house designers.”</p>

            <p>"A.Silva heads up a team that delivers classy home designs for very reasonable prices. Unlike other designers who bundle design with procurement, A.Silva simply charges a design fee and then uses her connections to source items (with discounts) separately per your budget and stays on the case until the project is complete. Total project costs are a fraction of rival designers. Wholeheartedly recommend.”</p>
